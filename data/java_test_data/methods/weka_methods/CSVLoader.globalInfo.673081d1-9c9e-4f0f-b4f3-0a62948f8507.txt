In " + "incremental mode, the first buffer full of rows is used to determine " + "the structure automatically. Following this all rows are read and output " + "incrementally. An error will occur if a row containing nominal values not " + "seen in the initial buffer is encountered. In this case, the size of the " + "initial buffer can be increased, or the user can explicitly provide the " + "legal values of all nominal attributes using the -L (setNominalLabelSpecs) " + "option.";
